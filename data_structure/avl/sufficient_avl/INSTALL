Installing libavl				-*- text -*-
=================

libavl is not intended to be installed as a shared library.  Instead,
its source files are meant to be included in programs directly.  A
given program normally uses only one or two of libavl's tree
structures.  Only the C source and header files for those structures
need to be included.  Refer to the libavl manual for more information.

As a result, there is no real "installation procedure" for libavl.  If
you like, you can install the test and demo programs in a convenient
location, but it hard to imagine a practical use for them other than
as tests and demonstrations.

Hence, this file gives information on what the libavl distribution
includes and how to build it.  It does not furnish an actual
installation procedure.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need the following software to fully build this version of libavl:

	* GNU make (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make).

	  Other make programs will not work.

	* TeX (http://www.tug.org).

	  You should install "e-TeX" extended TeX if possible, but
	  Knuth's TeX will also work, albeit more slowly.  You may
	  need to increase the pool size for your copy of TeX.  This
	  can sometimes be done by editing a file named texmf.cnf in
	  TeX's configuration directory.  Values of at least 250000
	  are known to work.

	* dvips.

	  dvips, often distributed with TeX, is needed to build a
	  PostScript version of the libavl manual.

	* GNU makeinfo (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/texinfo).

	  makeinfo is needed to build text, Info, and HTML versions of
	  the libavl manual.  Version 4.1 or later is required to
	  build the HTML version of the manual, but version 4.8 is
	  recommended, and this version or later is recommended in any
	  case.

	* GNU Ghostscript (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ghostscript) and
	  Imagemagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/).

	  You should only need these tools if you modify the .tree
	  files in the source distribution and want to build a custom
	  HTML or PDF version of libavl.  Ghostscript is used to render
	  PostScript to oversized PNGs and Imagemagick does
	  antialiased scaling to reasonable sizes.  Ghostscript is
	  also used in the process of converting PostScript to PDF
	  format.
	  
Building
--------

You can build all of libavl or just one part.  Here are the commands
to build a few interesting subsets:

	* Everything: `make'.

	* All versions of the manual: `make docs'.

	  - Manual in DVI format: `make libavl.dvi'.
	  - Manual in PostScript format: `make libavl.ps'.
	  - Manual in PDF format: `make libavl.pdf'.
	  - Manual in Info format: `make libavl.info'.
	  - Manual in plain text format: `make libavl.text'.
	  - Manual in HTML format: `make libavl.html'.

	* All the test and demo programs: `make programs'.

For a fairly comprehensive battery of tests, run `make check'.	This
may take several minutes.
